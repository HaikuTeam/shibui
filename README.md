# Shibui 渋い
Shibui is the design language powering the [Haiku for Teams](https://haikuforteams.com) brand. This project was created with and is powered by [Diez](https://diez.org).

Shibui is useful for both designers and developers. Many of tokens tokens generated by Diez into TypeScript originate from our team's source of truth design file found in `/designs/shibui.sketch`. Please clone this repo and add this Sketch file as a Library within Sketch in order to make its contents available to your UI design work.

If you make changes to `/designs/shibui.sketch`, please complete the following steps (or ask a developer for help) in order to see your updates affect our production applications:
1. Create a new branch
2. Run `yarn diez exact` from this repo's root directory
3. PR your changes to this repo with a description of the changes

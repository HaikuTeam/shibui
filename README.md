# Shibui 渋い
Shibui is the design language powering the [Haiku for Teams](https://haikuforteams.com) brand. This project was created with and is powered by [Diez](https://diez.org).

Shibui is useful for both designers and developers. Many of tokens tokens generated by Diez into TypeScript originate directly from our team's source of truth design file found in `/designs/shibui.sketch`. Please clone this repo and add this Sketch file as a Library within Sketch in order to make its contents available to your UI design work.

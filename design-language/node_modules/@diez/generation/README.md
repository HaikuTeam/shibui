# `@diez/generation`

This package deals with generating code for design languages based on its `CodegenDesignLanguage`, a way of describing a design language which is compatible with the design primitives provided by `@diez/prefabs`.

In addition to code generation, it provides contextual utilities for dealing with design primitives like typographs and color.
